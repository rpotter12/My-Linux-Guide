# Present Working Directory(pwd)
The current working directory is the directory in which the user is currently working in. Each time you interact with your command prompt, you are working within a directory.

Syntax:
```shell
$ pwd
```

```
Print the full filename of the current working directory.

       -L, --logical
              use PWD from environment, even if it contains symlinks

       -P, --physical
              avoid all symlinks

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
	      output version information and exit

If no option is specified, -P is assumed.

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of pwd, which usually
supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's
documentation for details about the options it supports.
